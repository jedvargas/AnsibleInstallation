# In Ansible machine/ansible server only (Assume you have the Master and 2 Nodes):
sudo su
yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
yum update -y
yum install git python python-level python-pip openssl ansible -y
ansible --version


#Add the private ip the node servers into the host file
vi /etc/ansible/hosts
#add [demo] above the line where you put the ip - this is the group name of the nodes (You can make your own)

#Uncomment the following lines from ansible.cfg
#from inventory (line 14) 
#from sudo-user (line 22

vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

#do the next stpe on all the ansible machine (Master and Node)
#create a user with the name ansible (or whatever you prefer)

adduser ansible
passwd ansible  

#Now we need to provide the authentication rights to the ansible user. So that the ansible user can perform sudo commands

visudo
#press i
#scroll down and find  #All root to run any command ....

#now there add 
ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL  #(Add this below root)  
#(line number: 101) 

#Do this step in ansible and node servers (We need tp edit authentication in sshd_config):
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#press i
#in authentication,
#uncomment Permit root login yes
#(remove #)   (line number 38) 
#scroll down and uncomment password authentication yes(by removing #) (line61) 
#and comment password authentication no
#(by putting #)(line 63) 

service sshd restart

#Apply sh-keygen to your nodes so you don't have to type password when connecting to the nodes from your master
#Go to ansible server  (you need to ensure that you are logged in as ansible user) 

ssh-keygen  #(press enter - enter - enter) 
ls -a
cd .ssh/
ls
ssh-copy-id ansible@<<private ip of node1>>
#Enter password : last time it will ask for pass
ssh-copy-id ansible@<<private ip of node2>>
#Enter password : last time it will ask for pass
cd ..
ssh <<private ip of node1>>
exit
ssh <<private ip of node 2>>
exit

Do this in ansible machine	
ansible all --list-hosts
ansible demo --list-hosts #shows the list in the demo group
